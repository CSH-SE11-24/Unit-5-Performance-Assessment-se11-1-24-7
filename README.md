How JavaScript helps with this website: 

- JavaScript allows my website to interact with user's action, such as when they put the mouse on the image, it will change from JPG to GIF



The feature I'm the most proud of is when you put your mouse over the logo, the theme of this website will change to a more of colorful style. 

If I had more time, I will add more information to my pages to make them more "professional."
